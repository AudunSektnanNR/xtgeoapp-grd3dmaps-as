How it works
============

Overview
--------

The scripts reads the Eclipse files and computes HCPV thickness per
cell, layer by layer.


Then the value and position of each cell (per layer) is
gridded by scipy/matplotlib to form a map.

The maps per layers are then summed, to form a sum hc thickness map
per zone or by all zones that are spesified.
