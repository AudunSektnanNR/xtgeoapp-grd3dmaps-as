How it works
============

Overview
--------

The scripts reads the Eclipse files or ROFF files and computes HCPV thickness
or weighted average per cell, layer by layer.


Then the value and position of each cell (per layer) is
gridded by scipy/matplotlib to form a map.

For HC thickness, the maps per layers are then summed, to form a
sum hc thickness map per zone or by all zones that are spesified.
